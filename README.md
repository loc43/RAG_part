# Dynamic Onscreen Tactical Assistant for DOTA-2

I created a RAG-system for DOTA-2 players that generates character charasterics based on his name using websites with character information.

It was later added to the game result prediction pipeline with a VLM for character detection (https://github.com/minashkinvladislav/DOTA)
